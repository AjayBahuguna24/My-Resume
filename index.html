                    <li><h4>Senior Software Engineer, Mogli Lab PVT LTB (7th Feb 2022-present)</h4></li>
                    <p>I worked as a senior Java backend developer on a project for Unilever. The 
                        focus of the project was to create a contract creation feature that would 
                        allow clients to easily place orders for products. My responsibilities included 
                        developing all of the necessary features to ensure that the contract creation 
                        process was seamless and user-friendly for Unilever's clients.<br>

                        As a senior member of the development team, I played a key role in mentoring 
                        and training junior developers and engineers. I imparted skills in Spring 
                        Boot, Java, and production issue troubleshooting to help them improve their 
                        performance and contribute effectively to the team. Additionally, I worked 
                        collaboratively with the team to implement strategies that would enhance the 
                        overall team performance.<br>
                        Collaborated closely with project managers, developers, quality assurance, 
                        and customers to effectively identify and resolve technical issues. By working 
                        in close partnership with all stakeholders, I ensured that technical problems 
                        were addressed in a timely and effective manner, enabling the team to deliver 
                        high-quality software solutions that met or exceeded customer expectations.
